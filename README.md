About: 

This dataset was constructed by hand for the Mobile App CoasterDex. An App that is currently under development, which, when complete, users will be able to use to track their rollercoaster credits as well as rank coasters and find out about them through the stats in the data set, as well as the links to Coasterpedia, Wikipedia and RCDB. 

Feel free to use this in your projects, but please attribute it to Coasterpedia, Wikipedia, and this database correctly. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other information: 

This database is still under development and only contains limited data. **It is incomplete.** Updates will be pushed over time; however, the current dataset contains only 313 rollercoasters, 81 other Attractions, and 123 parks. 

More data will be added over time.
